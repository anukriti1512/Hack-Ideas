      'A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. Some implementations of machine learning use data and neural networks in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.',

      'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported that it had logged 1,316 positive flu cases in its surveillance network between September 2020 and the end of January 2021. During that same period last year, the CDC had recorded nearly 130,000 cases. What will the healthcare sector look like after COVID-19? The health and immunity care system for people worldwide will only look significantly different this time if, as we emerge from this crisis, we decide to take action to resolve these problems and bring about fundamental change. As Hospital care undergoes a significant transformation with clear guidelines for medical practitioners about hospital admissions during emergencies, we expect you to propose innovative process and digital transformation solutions for the healthcare industry post the covid-19 world. 

      Application Idea : - 
On-Demand Check-ups: How can we move routine health check-ups to an online service? How can the patient own the data?

      'FutureFi - The Future of Finance
      The finance industry has already witnessed various changes and disruptions caused by FinTechs (Financial Technologies) such as mobile banking, mobile payment, and biometrics. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies have become a known phenomenon in recent years, but their real disruption potential in the financial industry has yet to be seized.
      
      Your task is to explore the possibilities in the FinTech domain and create innovative and meaningful finance-related applications or solutions using the  Algorand blockchain.
      
       
      
      Examples:
      
      Financial use: explicitly geared towards financial applications such as lending, exchange, derivative / synthetic asset issuance, asset management, etc.
      Permissionless: open-source; anyone can use or build on top of the projects without asking permission from a third party
      Pseudonymous: no need for people to reveal their identities to use the protocols
      Non-custodial: not reliant on third-party facilitators
      Decentralized governance: decisions and administrative privileges are not held by a single entity or a credible path exists towards removing them.
